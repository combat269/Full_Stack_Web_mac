/* - This means:
  - `h1` **inside `body`** gets **purple**
  - AND any `h2` (even outside of `body`, if it existed) also gets purple.
  
> ⚠️ **To apply both to `body h1` AND `body h2`**, write:
```css
body h1, body h2 {
  color: purple;
} */
body h1,h2 {
    color:purple;

/* parent is .box and child is .done; parent-child relationship */
/* - This targets **any `.done` element that is a direct child of `.box`** */
.box > .done{

}
/* ancestor is ul and descendant is li; css is applied on descendant */
/* - Applies to **all `li` elements that are inside `ul`** (even if deeply nested)
- All list items (`Wash Clothes`, `Read`, `Maths Questions`) turn **blue** — unless overridden. */
